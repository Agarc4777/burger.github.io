### Description
* ![Demo](assets\images\burgers.png)
* This app gives me a list of burgers that the user can input and edit from EAT to EATEN. The user will add a burger to the list that will fall under uneaten by default and when it has been consumed, the user will be able to press the eat button and change its status to eaten.
